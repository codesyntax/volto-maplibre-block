## Introduction

Volto block and component to render maps using the [maplibre](https://github.com/MapLibre/maplibre-gl-js) JS library, which is a fork of [Mapbox GL 1.x](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js).

To do so we use the [react-map-gl](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/docs) library, which supports both maplibre and [Mapblox GL](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js)

I have heavily based this block on [volto-leaflet-block](https://github.com/adeweb-be/volto-leaflet-block).

The point is that Leaflet has several issues with SSR and it is not ready to work on SSR and will not be ready to do so. So instead of doing ugly hacks, I have decided to create my own map block.

## Features

- A generic Map component, that can be used in your Volto developments.

- A Map block, that allows some basic configuration (used tiles, map center, zoom, and a list of markers (title, link and icon))

## Customization

You can add extra map layers, or remove existing ones, tweaking the `tileLayers` property of the block:

```js
const applyConfig = (config) => {
  // Own blocks
  config.blocks.blocksConfig['mapLibreBlock']['tileLayers'] = [
      {
        id: 'osm',
        name: 'OpenStreetMap',
        type: 'raster',
        urls: [
          'https://a.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',
          'https://b.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',
          'https://c.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png',
        ],
        tileSize: 256,
        attribution:
          '&copy; OpenStreetMap Contributors | Kartendarstellung &copy; OpenTopoMap (CC-BY-SA)',
        maxzoom: 19,
      },
    ]


  return config;
};

```

## Installation

To install your project, you must choose the method appropriate to your version of Volto.


### Volto 17 and earlier

Create a new Volto project (you can skip this step if you already have one):

```
npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto
yo @plone/volto my-volto-project --addon @codesyntax/volto-maplibre-block
cd my-volto-project
```

Add `@codesyntax/volto-maplibre-block` to your package.json:

```JSON
"addons": [
    "@codesyntax/volto-maplibre-block"
],

"dependencies": {
    "@codesyntax/volto-maplibre-block": "*"
}
```

Download and install the new add-on by running:

```
yarn install
```

Start volto with:

```
yarn start
```

### Volto 18 and later

Add `@codesyntax/volto-maplibre-block` to your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@codesyntax/volto-maplibre-block": "*"
}
```

Add `@codesyntax/volto-maplibre-block` to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const addons = ['@codesyntax/volto-maplibre-block'];
```

If this package provides a Volto theme, and you want to activate it, then add the following to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const theme = '@codesyntax/volto-maplibre-block';
```

## Test installation

Visit http://localhost:3000/ in a browser, login, and check the awesome new features.


## Development

The development of this add-on is done in isolation using a new approach using pnpm workspaces and latest `mrs-developer` and other Volto core improvements.
For this reason, it only works with pnpm and Volto 18 (currently in alpha).


### Pre-requisites

-   [Node.js](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project.html#node-js)
-   [Make](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project.html#make)
-   [Docker](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project.html#docker)
